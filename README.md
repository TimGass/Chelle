A small, but fun AI used to teach me java programming and as a proof of concept over open-ended AIs. 
Feel free to contribute if you want, I may add to it.
Contains free model of tokenizer from http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/datafiles/ as reference.
However, my tokenizer ended up being pretty different anyway, but I wanted to give credit for the original format.
